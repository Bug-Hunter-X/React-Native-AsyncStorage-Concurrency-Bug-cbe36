This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications involving the use of AsyncStorage.  The bug arises from the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage and the potential for race conditions when multiple operations are performed concurrently.  The solution provided uses Promises to ensure that operations are executed sequentially, preventing data corruption and ensuring data consistency.
